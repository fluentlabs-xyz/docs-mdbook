# Building a Blended App

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build a blended `HelloWorld` application on Fluent. It combines a Rust smart contract to print “Hello” and a Solidity smart contract to print “World.”

This setup demonstrates:

* composability between different programming languages (Solidity and Rust)
* and interoperability between different virtual machine targets (EVM and Wasm)

within a single execution environment.
