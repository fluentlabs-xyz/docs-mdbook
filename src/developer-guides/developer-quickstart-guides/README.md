# Developer Quickstart Guides

---
Get started building on Fluent
---

Fluent allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust, Solidity, or Vyper. Each language has its unique advantages and syntax, enabling developers to choose the best fit for their projects.&#x20;

This guide will walk you through creating a `HelloWorld` contract in each of these three languages and deploying it to Fluent.

## Get Started

To simplify the setup process, your project can be bootstrapped using Fluentâ€™s scaffold CLI tool. This tool automates the creation of the project structure and necessary directories for smart contract development.

### Install Fluent scaffold CLI tool

To install the Fluent scaffold CLI tool, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo install gblend
```

To create a project, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
gblend init
```

This will prompt you to choose from the available setup options:

* Solidity Smart Contract
* Vyper Smart Contract
* Rust Smart Contract

Select the option that aligns with your preferred programming language for smart contract development, and the CLI tool will set up the project structure accordingly.
